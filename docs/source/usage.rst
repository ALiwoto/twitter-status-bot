Non-functionality
-----------------

The bot commands ``/start`` and ``/help`` will display a short summary of the bots capabilities.

Generating a Sticker
--------------------

The bots most important functionality is the inline mode. To generate a sticker, simply type
``@TwitterStatusBot <your tweet>`` and select the generated sticker. It might take a moment
for the sticker to be build, so please be patient. Tweets can have a maximum length of 256 characters in inline mode.

Stickers can also be generated by texting ``<your tweet>`` directly to the bot. No length limit here, though tweets with
long text will be hard to read, as they are scaled to 512 pixels.

Statistics
----------

This bot uses the `ptbstats <https://hirschheissich.gitlab.io/ptbstats/>`_ plugin to make some usage statistics
available. The commands ``/text`` and ``/ilq`` will provide statistics on all stickers generated in private chat
with the bot and via inline queries, respectively. Note, that those commands will only work for the admin of the bot.
