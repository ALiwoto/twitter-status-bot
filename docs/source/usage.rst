Non-functionality
-----------------

The bot commands ``/start`` and ``/help`` will display a short summary of the bots capabilities.

Generating a Sticker
--------------------

The bots most important functionality is the inline mode. To generate a sticker, simply type
``@TwitterStatusBot <your tweet>`` and select the generated sticker. It might take a moment
for the sticker to be build, so please be patient. Tweets can have a maximum length of 256 characters in inline mode.

Stickers can also be generated by texting ``<your tweet>`` directly to the bot. No length limit here, though tweets with
long text will be hard to read, as they are scaled to 512 pixels.
